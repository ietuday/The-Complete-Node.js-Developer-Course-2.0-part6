1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,940
As I mentioned in the end of the last video starting from here on out the goal is to add a joined page

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,690
like the one you see here where you provide a name and you provide the room name you want to join.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,660
You'll then be able to join a given room talk to anybody else in that room and you won't be able to

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,050
communicate with other people in other rooms.

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,220
This means that when you click this form you're going to click join and we're going to have some custom

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,060
information passed into the you R-AL into the chat application as we know it.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,170
The one that looks like this.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,610
Now in order to get that done the first thing we're going to do is tweak the current age template file

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,310
right now indexed.

10
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,260
Tim L. is going to load first.

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,210
We actually don't want that to be the case when we go to local 3000.

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,230
We want to show our new joined page.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,440
So what I'm going to do instead is move this by renaming it we're going to rename index ADOT h DML to

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,590
chat dot h DML and I'm going to do the exact same thing with index dot J.S. renaming it to chat.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,260
J.S..

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,090
And last but not least I'm going to update the reference.

17
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,700
Down below where we load an index datcha Yes Instead we'll load and chat.

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,670
Yes.

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,380
Now that we have this in place we no longer have an HTL page that's going to load when you visit the

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,960
site.

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,130
If I try to go to localhost 3000 we're going to get an error saying we cannot get that route.

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,230
Nothing's coming back from the server to fix this.

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,350
We're going to create our brand new page as index dot h DML.

24
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,420
This is going to be the one that loads when a user visits the app.

25
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,820
Now we'll start off with the very basic template specifying things we've done before like a dock type

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,650
setting equal to H.T. in L5 and then we're going to go ahead and at our age Tamal tag inside of here

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:53,450
we can then add our head and body tags and I had my head tag first then I can go ahead and add my body

28
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:01,340
tag and we'll kick things off by adding a few tags into the head like Mehta So we can set our char set

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,080
right here.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,950
Charsadda is going to equal UTF 8 and we're also going to see a few other properties.

31
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,660
I'm going to set a title tag.

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,570
This is going to show up inside of the tab as the tabs title.

33
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:24,950
We can set ours to join then we can add a space a vertical line by using shift backslash and the name

34
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,310
of our app something like chat app.

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,300
This will show up in the tab a title and then we can go ahead and link in our stylesheet just like we

36
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,730
did for chat.

37
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,460
HTL right here.

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,250
I'm going to get that style sheet reference.

39
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:44,000
Copy it into the head and I'm going to add that title tag to chat h out right here in Schacht out aged

40
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,130
TNL know we can specify a title just like we did over inside of index dot h DML.

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,080
We can give this one a page of chat with a bar surrounded by spaces.

42
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,310
And we're also going to give it the same app name chat app.

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,350
Awesome.

44
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,790
Now that we have this in place there is one more thing I want to do before we start updating the body.

45
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,670
This is set a viewport.

46
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,840
Tag viewport tags let you specify certain things about how your site should be rendered.

47
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,720
The viewport tag I'm about to add is going to make our website display much better armed mobile instead

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,240
of being really zoomed out.

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,020
It's going to fit to the width of your phone tablet or any other device.

50
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,310
We're going to copy this tag from index that TNL to chat.

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,650
H.

52
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,780
Female when we're done.

53
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,650
But for now we'll kick things off by adding a metal tag this time around instead of specifying char

54
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,330
set like we've done in the past.

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,210
We're going to give it a name equal to view part.

56
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,730
And now we can go ahead and add a few options about what we want to do to that viewport.

57
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,860
All this is going to happen inside of content.

58
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,890
This is going to be a comma separated list of key value pairs one for example is with we're going to

59
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,170
set that equal to device hyphen with.

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,610
And this tells your browser to use the devices with as the web pages with then we can add a comma space

61
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,060
and specify our next key value pair.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,140
I'm going to use initials scale.

63
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,010
We're going to set that equal to 1.

64
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,680
This is going to scale the website appropriately so it doesn't look all zoomed out.

65
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,250
And finally user high and scalable will set that equal to.

66
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,540
No we have styles in place to make the text bigger and to make sure that user can always see everything.

67
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,080
So there's no reason to give users the ability to scale.

68
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,500
Now as mentioned we're going to take this matter a tag copy it to the clipboard and add it for chapter

69
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,640
HVM Tamal as well.

70
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,250
Awesome.

71
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:41,790
And now that we have our head tags set up for index HGL we can move on to the body we're going to be

72
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,880
using a similar set of classes designed to work with this page to get things off on the body.

73
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,180
We're going to add a class of centered hyphen form.

74
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,030
This is going to center that form in the screen and give the entire website that blue background with

75
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,040
the gradient.

76
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,720
Next up we can go ahead and provide the little box.

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,380
This is going to be the centered white box that has our form in it.

78
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:13,440
That's going to be via a div and we're going to give this div a class we're going to set that class

79
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,180
equal to inside of quotes centered high and form.

80
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,490
Underscore underscore form.

81
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,480
Awesome.

82
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,740
Now that we have these two classes in place we are ready to move on actually adding some of the fields

83
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,130
that are going to go in that white box starting with that title.

84
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,710
Chat to do this.

85
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,200
We're going to create a few divs they're all going to look identical so we'll make them once and duplicate

86
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,760
them.

87
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:41,560
And we're going to add a class equal to form high thin field.

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,460
Now we're going to use this four times once for the title once for the name.

89
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,160
Once for the room name and once for the button in order to get that done what we're going to do is simply

90
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,700
copy the line and paste it four times right here.

91
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,010
Now all of this needs to go inside of a form tag the whole goal of this page is to take that data and

92
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,050
submit it redirecting the user to the chat page where we can then bring them into a specific chat room

93
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,950
using the name they provided.

94
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,910
That means we want to wrap these form fields inside of a form tag by opening here and closing it down

95
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,670
below.

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,710
Now previously we saw the default behavior for a form tag is to reload the current page posting the

97
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,580
data as a query string.

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,120
Well we're going to do instead is specify an action attribute which lets us customize which page to

99
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,020
go to.

100
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,990
In this case we're going to go to a forward slash chat.

101
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,100
H TNL the page that we set up just now.

102
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,490
This means that when someone's done filling out the form field they're going to get redirected to the

103
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,630
chat page and the data down below will get passed along to.

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,610
Now the title div is easy or we're going to do is at an H three with whatever title you want.

105
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,100
You could say chat or join the chat.

106
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,770
That looks pretty good then I can go ahead and close my H-3 and move on to the next to form field which

107
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,770
is going to be the display name.

108
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,280
I am going to use a label a label is going to describe a field.

109
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:10,310
This one will be display name so will open and close the label tag like this and next up we can add

110
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,080
an input right here.

111
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,690
We're going to add an input just like we did for the input on our message form.

112
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,370
We're going to specify type equal to text.

113
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,790
We want the user to be able to enter some text and we're also going to give it a name equal to name.

114
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,260
We are going to use auto focus.

115
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,600
Once again this is going to make sure that when a user first visits the app their cursor is placed inside

116
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,490
of the name field.

117
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,270
Next up is the field for the room name which is going to look pretty similar to the one above.

118
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:45,740
We are going to start with a label once again this label is going to be a string something like room

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,790
name and we're also going to add an input right here.

120
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:58,930
So the user can specify the room name type equals text and the name will equal a room.

121
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:05,900
There is no need for autofocus on this one since we already have an auto focused input up above.

122
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,520
Now that we have this in place we can go ahead and the final form field which is going to be the submit

123
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,880
button for our form by simply creating a button just like this and giving it a text value.

124
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,210
We can have ours set to join with this in place our index.

125
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,280
Each time a file is actually done.

126
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,190
We can load it over inside of the browser.

127
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,630
Our server had automatically restarted.

128
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,380
So a quick refresh should show our page join a chat app.

129
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:40,650
The goal is to set this up to take a name like Andrew and a room name like Noad course students you

130
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,580
click join and it joins you into this room with this name.

131
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,280
Now currently it's going to do is redirect us to chat dot h TNL.

132
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,900
But as you'll see it does indeed pass the data along.

133
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,230
Here we have a name equal to Andrew and we have real name equal to Noad course students just like we

134
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,590
specified over inside of index dot h t.

135
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,620
And now with this in place we are now ready to start talking about how we can join a specific rooms

136
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,410
inside a socket I O.

137
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,190
Making sure the events we emit only go to other people connected to that room.

138
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,530
We have the stuff in place to get this done.

139
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,180
So we're gonna get started with all of that in the next video.

140
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,770
For now we have a pretty great looking joined page.

141
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,960
This is where we can join a room.

142
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,950
Let's wrap this up with a commit committing our changes.

143
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,420
If Iran gets status you're going to see that we have a modified file index.

144
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,450
H TNL.

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,730
And that also thinks we deleted index dot J us although we add something down below.

146
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,170
When we run get add dot and rerun get status to understand exactly what happened here you can see we

147
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,030
copied indexed HVM to chat.

148
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,910
HVM.

149
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,500
We then modified index.

150
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,590
H TNL and we renamed index dot J s to chat.

151
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,060
J asked.

152
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,190
Which is exactly what we did.

153
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,390
I'm going to go ahead and actually make the commit using get commit with the M flag and join page that

154
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,200
submits to chat DML.

155
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,070
We can then make the commit push it up to get how and that is it for this one.

156
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,700
I will see you next time
