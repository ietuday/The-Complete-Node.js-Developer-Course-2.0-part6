1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,090
In this video you're finally going to get some styles in place.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,140
So our app looks a little less like an ANS tiled h DML page and a little more like a real web app.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,770
Now on the left we have this people panel we're not going to be wiring that up yet although we are giving

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,700
it a place inside of our page.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,520
Eventually this is going to store a list of all the people connected to the individual chat room that's

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,810
going to come a bit later over here the main area is going to be the messages panel.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,290
Now the individual messages are still on styled.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,580
That's going to come later.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,290
But we do have a place to put all of that stuff Dambulla we have our footer This includes our form for

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,920
sending a message the text box and the button.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,120
And that also includes our send location button sitting right here.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,490
Now to get all of this done we're going to add a CSSA template that I've created for this project.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,580
We're also going to be adding some classes to our HDMI.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,260
All this is going to let us apply the various styles.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,050
And finally we'll be making a few small tweaks to our javascript to improve the user experience.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,650
Let's go ahead and Diven the first thing we're going to do is make a new folder and a new file to store

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,550
our styles.

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,800
This is going to be the template styles will be grabbing in just a moment.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,840
Then we're going to go ahead and load it into index dot HD.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,810
So those styles are used when we render the chat app.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,140
Now the first thing we're going to do is create a new folder inside of public and we're going to call

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,370
this folder CSSA and we're going to add just one file to it.

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,410
A new file called styles dot C Ss.

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,480
Now before we go off and grab any styles Let's go ahead and import this file into our application.

25
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,520
And in order to test and make sure that's working what we're going to do is write a very simple selector.

26
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,670
We're going to select everything using the star than inside of curly braces we're going to add a style

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
setting the color for everything equal to red.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Go ahead and make your file just like this one.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,600
We're going to save that and then we'll import it over inside of index dot each time M.

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,840
Right here at the bottom of the head tag below are met a tag we're going to add a link tag.

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,470
This is going to let us link a style sheet we have to provide two attributes to get that done.

32
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:14,070
First off we have to tell HVM exactly what we're linking to by specifying the RTL or relation attribute.

33
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,400
In this case we're trying to link a stylesheet.

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,250
So we're going to provide that as the value.

35
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,560
Now the next thing we need to do is provide the ref attribute.

36
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,830
This is similar to the source attribute for the script tag.

37
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,690
It's the path to the file you want to link.

38
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,230
In this case we have that at forward slash CSSA and we just created the file styles.

39
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,410
Success forward slash styles.

40
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:45,010
Dot C-s that's with this in place we can save index dot h TNL and give our page a refresh over inside

41
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,370
of the browser or load it up for the very first time.

42
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,990
And what we see is a hideously ugly page.

43
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,630
We've managed to make it even uglier than it was previously but this is great because it means our stylesheet

44
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,480
file is getting imported correctly now in order to grab the actual template.

45
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,380
We're going to be using for the chat app.

46
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:10,750
We're going to visit a u r l h t t p colon forward slash forward slash length's dot Meade dot IO my

47
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,690
site forward slash chat hyphen CSSA.

48
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,630
This is just a bit like length that's going to redirect you over to a jest.

49
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,990
And here we have two options we can grab either the minute style template or the.

50
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,820
UNIDENTIFIED one I'm gonna go ahead and grab this minute one by either highlighting it or clicking this

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,680
raw link which brings us to the file.

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,220
We're going to grab the entire contents we see here.

53
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,740
Head over into Adam and paste it inside of our CSSA file.

54
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,520
Removing obviously the previous selector.

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,580
Perfect.

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,610
Now that we had this in place we can give our page a refresh although we're not really going to see

57
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,090
much improvement over inside of localhost 3000.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,350
I'll give the browser a refresh and clearly things are different but it doesn't look anything like that

59
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,070
screen shot we had in the beginning of this video.

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,950
That is because we need to apply some classes to our DML in order to get everything to work correctly.

61
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,920
We're also going to need to tweak the structure adding a few container elements to help with alignment

62
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,750
over inside out and we can get this done in just a few minutes.

63
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,710
This template was built around a few key classes the first one needs to get applied to the body by setting

64
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:26,040
the class attribute equal to inside of quotes chat.

65
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,540
This tells the style sheet to load the styles for this chat page and we're going to go ahead and remove.

66
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,860
Welcome to the chat app.

67
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,160
This is no longer necessary.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,970
Now the next thing we're going to do is create a div and this div is going to house that people list

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,850
we saw on the left hand side.

70
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,140
It's going to be empty for the moment but that's fine.

71
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,440
We can still go ahead and create it right here.

72
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,430
We're going to make a div

73
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,790
and we're going to give this div a class and that class is going to get set equal to the following chat

74
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,390
underscore underscore that's two underscores side bar.

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,460
This is a naming convention used in some style sheet templates.

76
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,780
It's really a matter of preference.

77
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,640
You could call this whatever you want when you create the style sheet.

78
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,550
I happen to call it chat underscore underscore sidebar.

79
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,920
It's a sub element inside of the greater chat app.

80
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,180
Now inside of here we're going to add a little title using the header three tag we're going to give

81
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,000
this a title of people or whatever you want to call that side bar list.

82
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,420
And we're also going to provide a div which will eventually house the individual users although as I

83
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,150
mentioned we're not going to be wiring that up yet.

84
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,890
Now we can go ahead and give this an I.D. setting it equal to users so we can target it a bit later.

85
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,360
And that's all we need for the chat sidebar at the moment.

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,440
Now the next thing that we're going to do is create a div and that this debt is going to house that

87
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,810
main area which means it's going to contain not only our chat messages but also the little form at the

88
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,470
bottom everything on the right hand side of the sidewalk.

89
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,210
This also is going to require a custom class for some styles.

90
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,050
This one is called Chat underscore underscore Maine and inside of here we're going to add not only are

91
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,410
unordered lists but also our form and button.

92
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,930
Let's go ahead and take all of our current markup the unordered list down to the send location button.

93
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,500
Cut it out and paste it inside of chat main.

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,680
Now we're not quite done yet.

95
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,520
There are a few more things to tweak.

96
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,680
First up we have to add a class to our ordered list.

97
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,730
We'll set the class equal to chat messages.

98
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,770
This is going to provide the necessary styles and the last div we need to create is going to be for

99
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,550
that FOTR.

100
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,250
This is going to be the gray bar at the bottom that contains both your form as well as the send location

101
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,320
button.

102
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,820
We're going to make a div which is going to help with alignment.

103
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,870
And we're going to add the form and the button inside of it by kind of get out and pasting it right

104
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,040
in here.

105
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,480
Now we are going to need to add a class here too as you might have guessed setting the class attribute

106
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,820
equal to the string.

107
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,220
Chat underscore underscore footer.

108
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,120
Now we have all of our classes in place and we can head over to the browser and see what we get when

109
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,680
we give the page a refresh what we get is something a little similar to what we had previously.

110
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,880
But obviously there are some notable differences.

111
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,490
The footer is not quite rendering correctly.

112
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:27,410
If we head back over into ADOM we can take a look at just why right here we have a div this div has

113
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,650
a class of chapt footer but class was spelt wrong.

114
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,230
All I have to do is go ahead and fix that typo.

115
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,510
Give the browser a refreshed one more time.

116
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,280
And now we're getting the complete picture.

117
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,520
We have our styled chat application and we can still do whatever we were able to do before I can send

118
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,780
off a message hey this should still work.

119
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,440
Hit enter.

120
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,640
And hey this should still work shows up to the screen.

121
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,620
The same thing is true for send location.

122
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,660
I can send off my location is going to send it to the server.

123
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,150
It's going to send it to all the clients and right here I can click the my current location link and

124
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,840
the location is going to show up inside of Google Maps.

125
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,130
We've maintained all of the old functionality well adding a nice set of styles.

126
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,130
Now for the second half of this video I want to make some user experience improvements to the form down

127
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,590
below what improvement we're going to make as wiping the text value once a message was successfully

128
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,340
sent.

129
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,570
We're also going to do something similar with send location as you might have noticed it can take up

130
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,950
to a second or two for the send location geo location called to actually complete.

131
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,990
We're going to set this button to be disabled so someone doesn't span it.

132
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,380
Wondering what's happened.

133
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,620
We're also going to update the text to say sending location so someone knows that something is happening

134
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,880
in the background.

135
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:49,970
Now in order to get those things done all we need to do is modify a few lines over inside of index dot.

136
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,860
J.S. near the bottom of the file we have our two.

137
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Jay queery event listeners both of these are going to get changed.

138
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,470
Now the first thing we're going to change is going to be the form submit listener.

139
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,150
Right here we fetch the value from the field and that's what we pass along what we want to do down below

140
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,760
inside of the acknowledgement callback is clear the value once the request has been received by the

141
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,860
server there's no reason to keep it around.

142
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,590
So what we can do is add the same J Aquarius selector which will break out in just a moment.

143
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,920
Targeting the field worthy name attribute equals message and we're going to go ahead and clear its value

144
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,970
by calling Val once again.

145
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,240
But instead of getting a value by providing no arguments like we do here we're going to set the value

146
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,690
to an empty string by passing in an empty string as the first argument.

147
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,660
You could set the value to anything you like but in this case we just want to clear it.

148
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,550
So we're going to use the following method call.

149
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,570
Now we have the same selector twice to speed things up.

150
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,370
We're going to make a variable we'll call that variable message text box and then we can go ahead and

151
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,070
set it equal to the selector we just created down below.

152
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,840
And now we can refer to message text box any anywhere we need access to that input.

153
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:16,930
Right here we can reference it message text box and down below message text box.

154
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,670
Awesome.

155
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,620
Now the listener for create message which is over inside of server.

156
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,070
J.S. sits right here and we do indeed call the call back with a string.

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,510
For now we're going to just remove that bogus value passing zero arguments.

158
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,630
This means that the acknowledgement function will still get called over here but we don't actually need

159
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,160
any data.

160
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,130
We just need to know when the server responded.

161
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,330
Now that we have this in place we can go ahead and refresh things over inside of local host 3000 type

162
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,040
a message.

163
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,250
Here is a message and hit the enter key and what do we get.

164
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,090
We get the value cleared and was indeed sent.

165
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,900
The same thing is going to hold true if I type in a message and click the send button.

166
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,880
Now one thing we're going to do real quick is update the input tag for this text box.

167
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,340
If I refresh the page we're currently not brought right into the message feel that would be really nice

168
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,440
to do that would also be really nice to turn off auto complete as you can see auto complete isn't really

169
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,420
a useful feature.

170
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,970
It's hidden down below and the values inside of it are usually trash.

171
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,700
So what we're going to do over inside of Adam is add two attributes to customize the input.

172
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,780
The first one is going to be auto focus which doesn't require a value.

173
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,790
Autofocus is going to auto focus on this input when the template gets rendered and the second one we're

174
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,300
going to add is auto complete and we're going to set that equal to the string off.

175
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,400
With this in place we can save index dot HD and now head back over to Chrome refresh the page and test

176
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,660
things out.

177
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,950
I'm going to type in test right here.

178
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,570
I have no auto complete which is good.

179
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,510
We turned that off and if I clicked the send button I am indeed still sending the message.

180
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,730
I was also brought right into the text box when I reloaded the page.

181
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,650
I didn't need to do anything in order to start typing perfect.

182
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,870
The next thing we're going to do is customize that send location by using a bit more Jay query.

183
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,050
Now we're new to Jay Aquarians isn't really a jay queery course.

184
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,610
You can feel free to try to treat some of these as challenges though I won't be giving you many Jay

185
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,330
query related challenges.

186
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,570
We're going to stick to the challenges that require you to do some node code.

187
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,430
The goal here is to change the button text and disable it while the process is occurring.

188
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,930
When the process is complete meaning that the location was either sent or not sent we can return them

189
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,620
back into its normal state.

190
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,040
But well the geolocation call is happening.

191
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,140
We don't want someone spamming away to get that done.

192
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,080
We're gonna make some tweaks to the final on listener we have inside of index dot J s just below our

193
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,700
on submit listener We have our on click listener here.

194
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:54,130
We're going to need to make some changes to the button the location button variable we have defined

195
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,520
right here.

196
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,320
We're going to set an attribute that's going to disable the button to get that done.

197
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:08,480
We will reference the selector up above location button and we're going to call Jay Querrey method.

198
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,600
Now we're only going to disable it after we've confirmed that even have support for it.

199
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,570
If they don't have support for the feature there's no reason to go ahead and disable it right here location

200
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,390
button.

201
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,880
TR is going to let us set an attribute.

202
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,890
We're going to set the disabled attribute equal to the value disabled.

203
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,390
Now this disabled needs to be in quotes as well just like this.

204
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,870
Now that we have disabled the button we could actually test this out.

205
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,250
We never undecidable it so it's going to be broken after clicking at once.

206
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,990
But we can confirm that this line works over in the browser.

207
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,540
I'm going to give things a refresh click send location and you can see right away that the button does

208
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,500
get disabled.

209
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,030
Now it is going to send off location once but if I try to click it again the buttons disabled and it's

210
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,060
never going to refire the click event.

211
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,830
The goal here is to only disable it.

212
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,550
Well the process is actually occurring once it's sent like it is here.

213
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,670
We want to re-enable it so someone can send an updated location to get that done over inside of Adam.

214
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,790
We're going to add a line of Jay queery into both the success handler and the error handler.

215
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:20,870
If things go well we're going to reference location button and we're going to remove the disabled attribute

216
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,290
by using remove a TTR.

217
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,160
And this takes just one argument in the name of the attribute.

218
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,560
In this case we have that it's a string disabled.

219
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,990
This is going to remove the disabled attribute we defined above re-enabling the button and we can do

220
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,410
the exact same thing literally copying and pasting the line down below.

221
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,680
If for some reason we're not able to fetch that location maybe the user denied the request for geo location.

222
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,780
We still want to disable that button so they can try again.

223
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,610
Now that we have this set up we can test out that code by refreshing the browser and trying to send

224
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,020
off our location.

225
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,440
We should see the buttons disabled for a little bit and then it gets re-enabled.

226
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:00,930
There we go.

227
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,080
It's disabled.

228
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,630
It's about one to three seconds.

229
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,510
And there we go.

230
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,070
The location has been processed.

231
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,890
We can click it to prove that it is working as expected.

232
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,470
And the button was re-enabled which means we can go ahead and click it at a later time sending our location

233
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,810
once again.

234
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,870
Now the last thing we're going to do is update the button text.

235
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,380
Well the process is occurring to get that done over inside of Adam.

236
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,290
We're going to use that text method that we've used in the past right here.

237
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:38,120
We're going to set the text equal to my calling text sending location dot dot dot.

238
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,900
Now the real button text is send a location with a capital L..

239
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,450
I'm going to go ahead and lowercase that to keep things uniform.

240
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,150
Awesome.

241
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,130
Now that we have this set up we are updating the text while the process occurs.

242
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,470
The only thing left to do is tweak it back to its original value down below by setting text equal to

243
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:03,190
the string send location here and we're going to do the exact same thing down below calling text passing

244
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,930
in the string send location.

245
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,120
Excellent.

246
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,820
Now we can go ahead and test that this is working as expected.

247
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,370
Both of these lines are identical regardless of whether it succeeds or fails.

248
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,650
We're going to do the same thing over inside of chrome.

249
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,020
Going to give my page a refresh one more time.

250
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,760
We're going to click that send location button and you can see the button is disabled and the text was

251
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,950
changed sending location shows up and as soon as the process is complete and the location was actually

252
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,670
sent the button returns to its default state.

253
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,920
With this in place we now have a much nicer user experience than we had previously had only do we have

254
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,880
a nice set of styles.

255
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,770
We also have a better UI for our form and the send location button.

256
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,170
That is where we are going to stop for this one.

257
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:53,260
Let's go ahead and make a quick commit by shutting down the server running get status running get add

258
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,810
to add all of those files.

259
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:03,560
And finally we're going to go ahead and run get commit with the flag providing a message and see SS

260
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,200
for chat page.

261
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,480
We can go ahead and push this up to get how then I'm going to avoid deploying for Heroku right now although

262
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,500
you are welcome to deploy and test your application live.

263
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,740
And that is it for this one.

264
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,200
I will see you next time.
