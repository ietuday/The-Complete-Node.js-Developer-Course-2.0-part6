1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,160
Now that we have our people list in place and our messages are only getting sent to the users in the

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,290
same chat room we are done.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,420
But that doesn't mean you have to stop developing the chat app students like to add on new features

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,020
and they always post them in the Q&amp;A and it's really cool to see what people build.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,290
I like to give you a few ideas as to what you can build right now.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,450
You might get stuck with adding these features it might be a real pain in the butt and it might take

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:30,610
forever but I promise you're going to learn so much along the way and doing something on your own.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,250
They have all the skills to do these features so let's just go down the list really quick one awesome

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,820
idea would be to make chat rooms case insensitive.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,450
Currently if I go to EHLO TR with a lowercase are not actually in the same chat room as my friend who's

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,300
an EHLO TR uppercase r it would be nice if regardless of case we were all in the same room.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,310
Next up I'd like to make user names unique.

13
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:00,700
Currently I can copy the R L and paste in a new tab and now I have two people with the name of jewels.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,870
It would be cool to reject new users who also have the same name as an existing user.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,760
Next up one idea that I was thinking about adding that would be pretty cool is to add a list of the

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,590
currently active chat rooms down below.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,060
This could be a select dropdown.

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,180
It's going to repopulate.

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,770
Kind of like the People's list repopulate.

20
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,830
This is by far the hardest feature but I think it would be really cool.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,210
That means I would see a drop down in between the join and the input box and it would have the two currently

22
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,170
active rooms.

23
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,990
Hello TR and EHLO TR with an uppercase are although hopefully if you implement that first feature we

24
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,690
would only see one room.

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,380
Then instead of typing in a room name I could just pick one from the dropdown type in a name and join

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,150
that way.

27
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,560
These are just a few ideas of how you can continue on with a chat app if you do end up adding any of

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,890
these.

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,210
I would love to see what you built.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:58,620
Please post it in the Q&amp;A with a link to the Heroku application or any other link that lets me play

31
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,730
around with it and that's it for now.

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,260
I will see you soon
