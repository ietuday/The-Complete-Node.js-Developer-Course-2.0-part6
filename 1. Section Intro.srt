Welcome to Section 9 a real time web apps with socket I O.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,480
In this section you're going to learn about socket IO and web sockets which enable two way communication

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,820
between the server and the client.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,450
This means that we're not only going to be setting up a node server We're also going to be setting up

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,000
a client this client could be a web app it could be an iPhone app or an Android app for this course.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,570
The client will be a web application.

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,900
This means that we're going to be connecting the two allowing data to flow seamlessly from either the

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,070
browser to the server or from the server to the browser.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,730
Now with our to do app data can only flow in one direction the client had to initialize the request

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,040
with socket I O.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,220
We're going to be able to send data back and forth instantly.

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,960
This means that for real time apps like an email app a food ordering app or a chat app the server doesn't

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,450
need to wait for the client to request information the server can say hey I just got something you probably

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,490
want to show the user.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,640
So here it is.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,630
This is going to open up a world of possibilities and we're going to get started by figuring out how

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,320
to integrate SOC and I go into a node app.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,090
That's exactly what we're going to get started.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,380
So let's dive in.
